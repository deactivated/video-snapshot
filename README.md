# What is this?

video-snapshot is a Chrome extension for taking screenshots of
HTML 5 embedded videos.

Unlike a standard screenshot application, video-snapshot captures the
video frame in the original video resolution, regardless of the
current window size; if you're watching a 720p video on YouTube then
the screenshot will be 720p.

Because video-snapshot relies on HTML 5 canvas, it doesn't use
NPAPI and works on every platform that Chrome supports.

# Limitations

- video-snapshot does not work with Flash video.
- video-snapshot only takes screenshots of the first video on a page.
